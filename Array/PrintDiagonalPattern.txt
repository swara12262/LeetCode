Notice the following pattern

15 19 22 24 25
10 14 18 21 23
 6  9 13 17 20
 3  5  8 12 16
 1  2  4  7 11
Numbers increase in the direction of the diagonal from bottom to top.

Another example ( With dimensions  )

You will be given some test cases. In each test case ; you will be given dimensions of the grid. You need to print the given pattern.

Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer  ; denoting the number of test cases.

Then ;  lines follow ; where each line contains two space seperated integers  and  : the number of rows and columns respectively of the pattern that you need to print.

Constraints




The sum of  does not exceed  for all test cases.

Output Format

For each test cases ; print the required pattern.

The numbers within a row of the pattern shall be seperated using a single space.

Yes ; in the examples ; some numbers within a row do contain more than one space. But that is done purposely ; just so that you may observe the pattern a bit more easily.

You don't need to put multiple spaces between some of the numbers.

See sample test case for the same examples above to clarify !
